Starting with react and es6, looking for some simple template here you got your page :)

##### Extra files used :

.babelrc - It's a 'standard' place for different tools to find it, and allows Babel to use different configuration for different files during the same build
Ref: https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/

.editorconfig: EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs
 Ref: http://editorconfig.org/

.eslintrc: ESLint is designed to be completely configurable, meaning you can turn off every rule
Ref: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring

.gitignore: A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
Ref: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
